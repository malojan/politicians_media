# Collect data on french politicians' media appearances

This repo contains a script that collect data on the media appearances of french politicians, scraping information from [politiquemedia](https://www.politiquemedia.com/). The webiste monitors and records the invitations of politicians on TV and radio broadcasts. 

# Some ideas for the analysis

- From a media angle : Political leaning of media appearance, calculate an index of diversity, look at how it has evolved over time.
- From a politicians angle : calculate stats on appearances and visibility, merge this data with other data on politicians. 
- Why do politicians get into the news ? What is the effect of media apperance ? Link data with approval/popularity for both parties and politicians
